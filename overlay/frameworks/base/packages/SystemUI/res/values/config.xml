<!-- Device configuration setting the minfree tunable in the lowmemorykiller

keeping more memory in the file cache and preventing I/O thrashing, but
allowing fewer processes to stay in memory.  A low value will keep more
processes in memory but may cause thrashing if set too low.  Overrides the
default value chosen by ActivityManager based on screen size and total memory
for the largest lowmemorykiller bucket, and scaled proportionally to the
smaller buckets.  -1 keeps the default.

tunable in the kernel (if it exists).  0 uses the default value chosen by
ActivityManager.  A positive value  will increase the amount of memory that the
kernel tries to keep free, reducing allocation time and causing the
lowmemorykiller to kill earlier.  A negative value allows more memory to be
used by processes but may cause more allocations to block waiting on disk I/O
or lowmemorykiller.  Directly added to the default value chosen by
ActivityManager based on screen size.
